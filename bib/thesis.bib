  abstract = {Labour migration is a challenge for the globalised world due to its long-term effects such as the formation of transnational families. These families, where family members of migrant workers are ``left-behind'', are becoming a common phenomenon in many low- and middle-income countries. Our systematic literature review investigated the effects of international parental labour migration on the mental health and well-being of left-behind children. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed searches in PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar, resulting in 30 finally included studies. We found that mental health and well-being outcomes of left-behind children differed across and sometimes even within regions. However, only studies conducted in the Americas and South Asia observed purely negative effects. Overall, left-behind children show abnormal Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores and report higher levels of depression and loneliness than children who do not live in transnational families. Evidence from the studies suggests that gender of the migrant parent, culture and other transnational family characteristics contribute to the well-being and mental health of left-behind children. Further research utilising longitudinal data is needed to better understand the complex and lasting effects on left-behind children.},

  abstract = {China's rapid urbanisation has induced large numbers of rural residents to migrate from their homes in the countryside to urban areas in search of higher wages. As a consequence, it is estimated that more than 60 million children in rural China are left behind and live with relatives, typically their paternal grandparents. These children are called Left Behind Children (LBCs). There are concerns about the potential negative effects of parental migration on the academic performance of the LBCs that could be due to the absence of parental care. However, it might also be that when a child's parents work away from home, their remittances can increase the household's income and provide more resources and that this can lead to better academic performance. Hence, the net impact of out-migration on the academic performance of LBCs is unclear. This paper examines changes in academic performance before and after the parents of students out-migrate. We draw on a panel dataset collected by the authors of more than 13,000 students at 130 rural primary schools in ethnic minority areas of rural China. Using difference-in-differences and propensity score matching approaches, our results indicate that parental migration has significant, positive impacts on the academic performance of LBCs (which we measure using standardised English test scores). Heterogeneous analysis using our data demonstrates that the positive impact on LBCs is greater for poorer performing students.},

We are interested in clarifying whether the mechanisms behind this optimism are related to migrant selectivity or family migration experience. To do this we use data from the China Education Panel Study, a representative survey of junior high school students in China. We use a two-pronged analytical strategy. Firstly, we look at whether having experienced family migration (within China) is associated with higher educational expectations. Secondly, we take a step back and explore whether adolescents who wish to migrate themselves when they grow up report higher educational expectations. Our findings confirm that adolescents who wish to migrate themselves when adults are already more optimistic even before any intentions of moving come to fruition. This we take as an indirect proof of selectivity. In contrast, we find no effect of family migration on expectations.},

School performance is measured through an index of grades in language, mathematics and science. The results show that international parental migration (Ghana), the internal parental migration accompanied by divorce/separation (Nigeria) and migration of both parents (Ghana and Nigeria) are likely predictors for decreased school performance. No effects are observed when parents are abroad and divorced/separated, when only one parent migrates, when children are in a stable care arrangement or when children receive remittances or not. The analyses show that the overall relationship between parental absence and education varies by the transnational dimension being analysed and by context.},

  abstract = {China's rapid development has led to an unprecedented increase in migration rates as an evergrowing number of rural residents migrate to urban areas to seek better job opportunities and help alleviate family poverty. Economic pressures and structural restrictions force many of these migrant workers to leave their children behind in their rural homes, which has led to the emergence and expansion of a new subpopulation in China: left-behind children (LBCs). This study examines the impacts of parental migration on the educational outcomes (specifically math achievement) and mental health (specifically anxiety) of LBCs using data covering 7495 children in a prefecture of Shaanxi Province (from three surveys conducted between 2012 and 2014). We distinguish between ``both parents migrating,'' ``one parent migrating,'' ``only a father migrating,'' and ``only a mother migrating.'' We also explore the impacts on male versus female LBCs. We find no significant impact of parental migration on the math achievement of LBCs. In terms of mental health, however, our results indicate that left-behind girls were negatively affected by one parent migrating, especially if the migrating parent was the father. The findings suggest that it may not be necessary for policy makers to design special programs to improve educational outcomes of LBCs in general. However, local committees, schools, and parents should pay particular attention to left-behind girls living with only one parent, as they may be more vulnerable to mental health problems than their peers.},

The analyses revealed different patterns of relations of mother migration and father migration to children's adjustment. Whereas mother migration was negatively associated with children's social competence and academic achievement and positively associated with children's psychological problems, father migration was positively associated with children's positive adjustment, mainly through the mediation of maternal support. The results concerning the different implications of father migration and mother migration for children's adjustment and the critical role of maternal support represent a significant contribution to the understanding of human development in the contemporary rural Chinese context.

Surprisingly, if parental migration lasts longer (totaling two years), these adverse effects disappear, and student's educational expectations even improve. These results may be because, over time, the adverse effects that occur immediately after parental migration are offset by the positive effects of migration (i.e. higher income). These conclusions can inform migrant parents on ways to utilize their resources to improve the academic performance of their left-behind children.},

Given the effects of child\textendash parent separation (CPS) on development, this phenomenon has drawn considerable governmental and academic attention in recent years. Outlining developments with reference to relevant studies, this review characterizes the perspectives used to explore and understand this phenomenon in terms of three major paradigms: (1) the diagnostic approach, which takes for granted the assumption that CPS would be the only cause of negative effects observed among left-behind children (LBC), and has focused primarily on measuring psychological and behavioral disorders among these ``problematic kids''; (2) the advanced diagnostic approach, which refines the previous approach by incorporating theories and techniques developed outside of China, elaborating on the early approach by bringing into consideration more factors and exploring the interactions between CPS and these factors, particularly social ones; (3) the sociologically oriented approach, which provides the research with a much broader framework in terms of how to orient the phenomenon of LBC, especially the transformation of China's social and economic systems during the last 30 years of urbanization, where the reproduction of labor has been based on a ``splitting family structure,'' such that problems associated with the phenomenon of LBC cannot be solved without systematic social and economic changes. Based on these analyses, future directions for research on LBC in China are also discussed.},

Through critically interrogating public discourses based on articles from a mainstream newspaper and policy documents since the early 2000s, this article situates a sociological inquiry into the discursive and institutional framework addressing `the left-behind children problem' in China within the problematic of the relationship between children, family, and the state. The analysis reveals seemingly `disingenuous' articulations of left-behind children's value in the mainstream media and official policies. On the one hand, there seems to be a prevailing concern over the welfare of left-behind children which has grave implications for the country's future development. On the other hand, the dominant discourse attributes left-behind children's `miserable' plight to their `pathological' family life, which translates into policy efforts to discipline rural migrant families according to a family ideology rooted in urban middle-class experiences. I argue that such inconsistencies should be contextualized in the state's neoliberal-authoritarian governance of the migrant population in the post-reform era, which perpetuates a stereotype of `the pathological family' to account for left-behind children's disadvantages while evading, hence up until recent years avoiding to redress, the political-economic factors underlying their plight. I conclude the article by ruminating on the theoretical, social and policy implications of this study.},

We develop an analytical framework that incorporates three mechanisms\textemdash intergenerational social contract, non-cognitive skills, and cumulative (dis)advantage across the life course\textemdash to empirically assess gendered achievement patterns and their social mechanisms among Chinese adolescents. The Chinese Family Panel Studies data documented that adolescent girls have higher verbal and math achievements than boys, with the gap larger in verbal than in math scores. Three factors account for these gender gaps: (1) (grand)parents hold higher expectations for girls, monitor girls more closely, and invest in girls as much as in boys; (2) girls possess better non-cognitive skills; and (3) girls' stronger performance in earlier years gives them an edge for later achievement. The in-depth interviews contextualize these statistical patterns in profound changes in families' logic in supporting girls' education and in reconfigured gender discourses about girls' learning behavior. From the perspective of intergenerational contracts, in the context of low fertility, daughters have become cherished as long-term family members at the receiving end of intensive investment, particularly as educational competition intensifies in post-reform China. Moreover, a gender discourse, engaged by family members and teachers, about girls' superior non-cognitive skills such as compliance and self-discipline exerts a powerful influence as a self-fulfilling prophecy with regards to girls' achievement. The findings underscore the need to account for both cultural and policy contexts, and nuanced gender work at home and in school in understanding the gender-gap reversal in contemporary China.},

  abstract = {As a result of China's rural\textendash urban bifurcation, millions of rural Chinese children grow up in the absence of one or both parents due to work migration. Contrary to the dismal picture of left-behind children that is depicted by the mass media, comparative studies based on large-scale survey data suggest that left-behind children do not fare worse than those who live with both parents. Researchers have suggested that the positive effects of remittance might outweigh the negative effects of parental absence, and this explains why there is little total effect of parental migration on children's wellbeing. This, however, does not explain why left-behind children are doing equally well as non-left-behind children in nearly all aspects of life, some of which are affected more by parental care than by economic resources. This paper aims to explore what factors contribute to the all-round resilience of rural left-behind adolescents. Mixed methods were used to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from adolescents, caregivers, and school teachers from a migrant-sending community in central China. Data analyses reveal that adolescent interpretation of parental migration is deeply embedded in Chinese values on education and ideals of mutual responsibilities among family members, and that a positive understanding of parental motivation for labor migration and commitment to education are significant contributors to the resilience displayed by left-behind adolescents. The heterogeneities in the reaction of left-behind adolescents to parental migration demonstrate that the positive perception of parental migration is not a stand-alone protective factor.},

Using three-wave panel survey data, I rely on an instrumental variable strategy to address the non-random selection into migration. I identify important and gender-differenced schooling and labour supply responses. My findings suggest that boys living in migrant households are less likely to lag behind at school or work. At the intensive margin, they also report fewer hours of work per week. On the other hand, left-behind teenage females undertake a higher number of domestic chores. They appear to marry earlier as well. The migration impact on boys appears to be driven by remittances and the improved financial situation of households. The absence of any positive influence on the education of left-behind girls is likely to be explained by Tajikistan's cultural norms and institutions.},

Most studies focus on the short-term consequences and there is an urgent need to study the long-term consequences. Objective: Capitalizing on a unique survey in China, we aim to study the lasting educational and health consequences of parental migration on children. Methods: We measure respondents' experiences of being left behind during different stages of life, namely prior to elementary school, during elementary school, and during middle school. Among people who have experienced being left behind, we further classify the experience into several categories such as left behind with grandparents and left behind with others. We estimate a variety of regression models taking into account respondents' different living arrangements when growing up. Results: We find that being left behind with grandparents during the elementary school stage compromises educational attainment. Individuals who were left behind with others during primary school were more likely to have poor self-rated and mental health at the time of the survey. The long-term educational and health consequences of parental migration raise new concerns for today's left-behind children. Conclusions: We show that parental migration, especially during elementary school years, is likely to have long term consequences for children's educational and health outcomes. Contribution: We show that parental migration has long-term consequences for children's educational and health outcomes.},

Thus, it is considerably important for us to understand the effects of lack of parental care on the health status of left-behind children. Using data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we find that the left-behind children in rural areas are significantly 20.0\% more likely to get sick or develop chronic conditions than those living with their parents. We also find that girls are more vulnerable than boys and younger children are more vulnerable than older children to lack of parental care.},

This empirical strategy allows us to avoid the endogeneity issue concerning the migration decision that may have contaminated previous studies. We find evidence that return migrant parents help alleviate the harms caused by parental migration, and the remediation effect is stronger for children attending middle schools, and stronger for daughters. We also find suggestive evidence that return migrant parents improve children's performance through increases in after-school study time and education-related expenditures, following the return of migrant parents.},

Left-behind children have a lower cognitive test score and academic test score, and they are also less likely to attend a college. In particular, a mother's absence seems to have persistent negative effects on children's development. Mechanism analyses show that parental absence may result in a less healthy mental status of children and reduce children's efforts in class.

Importantly, though, families' enactments of these repertoires varied by the adults' social locations as well as by the characteristics of the local schools, including whether schools provided accommodation and meals and whether there was a buoyant private school sector. Certainly, schools significantly supplemented rural families' child-raising, albeit differently across different families and localities, with rural teachers commonly perceiving that parental migration worsened rural adults' lack of involvement in their children's education, exacerbating their own professional burdens. However, contrary to the teachers' and the wider society's perceptions, rural adults were deeply committed to their children's education, with this commitment underlaying their repertoires of care.},

I find that my respondents' spatial reflexivity was inseparable from their perception of their villages as home fort, stepping-stone or sanctuary, with these perceptions partly reflective of their households' non/involvement in migration and economic conditions. At the same time, stayers' views of their villages interacted with context-specific gendered ideas about space, obligation and competence, to affect what staying meant to them. This article concludes that even as staying in China's rural interior was an actively worked out process, individuals' spatial reflexivity was mediated and constrained by multi-scalar inequalities, which were in turn naturalized by a pervasive gendered moral geography.},

Based on my interviews with forty-four left behind children of two migrant parents and twenty-nine children who lived with both their parents, this article demonstrates that the children's deep feelings about their own family's circumstances impacted on their perceptions about the situation of children being `left behind'. The children's views reveal implications of parental migration that are more complex than neat delineations of trade-offs between costs (reduced parental care) and benefits (increased income) suggest.

Findings reveal that these adolescents `understand' the reasons for their parents' migration in a way that both gives coherence to this migration and invests young people with resilience and coping strategies. As a result, all the young people naturalised having to live with sadness, reflecting the `normalisation' of this social cost in wider Tajik society. However, the experiences and coping strategies of those interviewed are gendered; boys were more likely to `rationalise' their experience and be aloof; girls more likely to express emotional upset. In practical terms, boys also received more benefits from remittances while girls reported feeling overwhelmed by domestic chores expected of them.

In addition, emotional support from staying-behind fathers is found able to moderate the emotional costs of being separated from migrant mothers, but then only for boys. Findings reveal the roles of parent and child gender in the ``migration\textendash left behind nexus.''},

  abstract = {Most of the research evaluating the import of paternal migration for children's outcomes has taken `left-behind children' as a single group. Taking a life course perspective, this paper distinguishes fathers' short-term and long-term migrations, as well as return migration, as they affect children's productive activities. Using the Mexican Family Life Survey (2002\textendash 2009), we followed school-aged children from two-parent households in 2002 and observed their activities as they transitioned into adulthood from 2005 through 2009. We found that fathers' short-term migration is negatively associated with children's labor force participation, especially for 12 \textendash{} to 18-year-old boys, suggesting that paternal migration may interrupt adolescent boys' labor market transition in the short-term. Fathers' long-term migration and return migration does not significantly alter children's activities. However, the negative role of fathers' long-term absence and benefits brought by the paternal migration trip are important mechanisms for educational persistence and the labor force entrance of 12 \textendash{} to 18-year-old girls, highlighting the conditions under which certain mechanisms may work. This suggests that migration is a family process, with the outcomes lying in the interplay of the stages of migration, children's life stages, and how gender is treated within cultural and familial contexts.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that the increasing complexity of family life could be a factor in declines in internal migration (long-distance moves within countries). As many separated parents continue to share childcare responsibilities or have visiting arrangements, their mobility is naturally constrained. However, the relationship between family complexity and individual migration behaviour has never been studied explicitly. We compare separated parents with parents in two-parent families in their likelihood of migrating within the Netherlands. We use detailed records of parents' partnership status and children's residential situation. An event-history analysis was performed using register-based population data (N\,=\,442,412). We find that separated, single parents are more likely to migrate than those in two-parent families. The same is true for repartnered mothers, while repartnered fathers are about as likely to migrate as fathers in two-parent families. Separated parents' migration behaviour depends on where their children live. Having non-resident children who live some distance away is associated with a much higher likelihood of migrating than having resident children or non-resident children who live nearby. Having both resident and non-resident children who live nearby\textemdash shared residence (i.e. joint physical custody) is likely common in this situation\textemdash is associated with a considerably lower likelihood of migrating than having resident children only. Based on our findings, one would expect family complexities stemming from parental separation to be associated with higher rather than lower levels of migration. However, potential future increases in the number of parents who share physical custody after separation might lead to lower migration levels.},

  abstract = {Purpose China's rapid pace of urbanization has resulted in millions of rural residents migrating from rural areas to urban areas for better job opportunities. Due to economic pressures and the nature of China's demographic policies, many of these migrants have been forced to leave their children with relatives \textendash{} typically paternal grandparents \textendash{} at home in the countryside. Thus, while income for most migrant families has risen, a major unintended consequence of this labor movement has been the emergence of a potentially vulnerable sub-population of left-behind children (LBCs). The purpose of this paper is to examine the impacts of parental migration on both the academic performance and mental health of LBCs. Design/methodology/approach Longitudinal data were drawn from three waves of a panel survey that followed the same students and their families \textendash{} including their migration behavior (i.e. whether both parents, one parent, no parent migrated) \textendash{} between 2015 and 2016. The survey covers more than 33,000 students in one province of central China. The authors apply a student fixed-effects model that controls for both observable and unobservable confounding variables to explicate the causal effects of parental migration on the academic and mental health outcomes for LBC. The authors also employ these methods to test whether these effects differ by the type of migration or by gender of the child. Findings The authors found no overall impact of parental migration on either academic performance or mental health of LBCs, regardless of the type of migration behavior. The authors did find, however, that when the authors examined heterogeneous effects by gender (which was possible due to the large sample size), parental migration resulted in significantly higher anxiety levels for left-behind girls. The results suggest that parental migration affects left-behind boys and girls differently and that policymakers should take a more tailored approach to addressing the problems faced by LBCs. Originality/value The main contributions of this paper come from the large and representative sample, as well as the causal effects analysis of being left-behind on both academic performance and mental health. First, the paper uses comprehensive panel data from a representative and populous province in China, and the sample size is the largest one among LBC-related papers to the authors' knowledge. Second, the paper separately examines the causal effects on the student outcomes of different migration strategies. Third, the paper analyzes the heterogeneous effects of different migration strategies on LBC gender. The authors believe that the paper makes a key contribution to the literature.},

This paper examines the causal spillover effects of left-behind children on their classmates living with parents in rural China, exploiting the random assignment of students to classes within middle schools. We find that the proportion of left-behind children in class has a significant negative impact on the mental health of their classmates. We also show that the negative peer effects on mental health are related to the worsening of both classroom climate and peer-to-peer interactions. However, there is no evidence that exposure to left-behind students impairs the academic performance of their peers in the same classroom. Our findings suggest that the welfare losses of China's rural children resulting from the rural\textendash urban migration of adult population are larger than previously thought after accounting for the negative social spillovers of left-behind children on their peers.},

We found robust associations of family income with school grades, cognitive ability, and study attitude, but not with homework engagement. Moreover, we found that home amenities, i.e., measuring home-based material resources, played the largest mediating role in explaining family income effects on cognitive ability and study attitude. Among the non-monetary or intangible intervening factors, children's own and peers' educational aspirations along with mother-child communication were the most important mechanisms. To a lesser extent, family income effects were also attributable to harmonious parent-child and between-parent relationships. The key take-home message is that home environments constitute a prominent setting outside of school exerting powerful influences shaping school outcomes for Chinese adolescents. Our study contributes to a better understanding of how family economic resources are transmitted to children's cognitive and educational advantages via home material resources, family non-monetary features, children's agency, and peer influence.

This study uses survey data collected in 2010 and 2013 from school children and youths aged 11\textendash 20 in Ghana (N = 1,622) and China (N = 2,171), respectively. Results indicate that children (a) who previously migrated but returned and currently live with both parents and (b) who currently stay behind and have no previous migration experience are generally less likely to be satisfied with life. On the other hand, greater resilience in the outcome is associated with emotional support from parents. Also, there is suggestive evidence that Chinese girls are more vulnerable to the effects of parental migration and of being, at one point of life, migrant themselves. This evidence is not replicated among Chinese boys. In Ghana, girls of migrant parents without a personal migration experience and boys in non-migrant families who returned from abroad show some degree of vulnerability when assessing their life satisfaction. These findings add nuance to a field of research that has yet to conceptualise the complexity of children's experiences with migration and the way this complexity associates with child well-being.},

The findings suggest lower cognitive achievement in communities that experience high migration intensity. Living in a community with a large proportion of people who have migrated away from the community is associated with a 3.57-unit decrease in verbal scores and a 1.54-unit decrease in maths scores, which is equivalent to missing 1.67 and 0.87 years of schooling, respectively. A possible explanation for this effect is the change in demographic composition such that communities are depleted of better educated adults.},

In China, more than 100 million children are directly affected by the massive internal migration. Objective: This study investigates the impact of different migration processes (parental migration, child migration, and hukou conversion) on Chinese children's developmental outcomes, measured by their cognitive abilities, school engagement, school attachment, physical and mental health, educational aspirations, and confidence about the future. Methods: We analyze the data from a nationally representative, school-based survey covering approximately 20,000 children aged 12 to 16 in both rural and urban areas. We employ the propensity score matching method to ensure different groups of children are intrinsically comparable to each other. Results: Migration both brings benefits and imposes costs on children. Bringing rural children to cities significantly improves their school performance and physical health but also reduces their educational aspirations and increases their anxiety toward the future. Leaving children behind in the countryside, while sparing them from potential social exclusion in cities, results in a negative impact on their physical and mental health. Gaining local urban hukou status improves rural-origin children's academic achievements but has no effect on the other well-being indicators. Conclusions: These results reveal that the current migration processes and China's hukou system have generated both opportunities and challenges for the children involved. Contribution: The conceptual framework set out in this paper enables researchers to obtain a more comprehensive picture of migration's impact on children's well-being rather than looking at small fragments of the larger story.},

While most existing studies have focused on the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of school engagement of migrant children compared to local children, the emotional dimension has received less scholarly attention. Using a large-scale, national representative, school-level longitudinal survey data conducted in 2014 in China, this study examined the effect of migration status on children's emotional engagement in school. Methods This study was conducted with 15,872 Chinese junior high school students (mean age = 13.52, SD = 1.24) using ordered logistic regression. KHB mediation analysis was employed to explain migration-emotional engagement linkage. Results Compared with urban local children, both rural and urban migrant children are less likely to feel closely connected to their peers in school and are more likely to feel bored and to express escapism. The KHB mediation analysis further suggests that compared with the number of friends and proportions of the same-school friends, the percentages of local friends at the same school mediate most of the effect of migration status on all three measures of emotional engagement, particularly for rural migrant children. Conclusions These findings revealed that although both social exclusion and the absence of friendship play statistically significant mediation roles, social exclusion is of vital importance in understanding the differences between migrant and local children in emotional engagement.},
